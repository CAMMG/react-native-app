# react-native-media-kit

Video(and audio) component for react-native apps, supporting both iOS and Android, with API similar to HTML video.

A default set of controls is provided to play/pause, seek and to display current playback and buffer progress.

Runs on react-native 0.28+. Supported media types:

* iOS: Should be same as those supported by [AVPlayer](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AVFoundation/Reference/AVPlayer_Class/)


* Android: Shold be same as those supported by [ExoPlayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer)

#### Android

**android/settings.gradle**

```

```

**android/app/build.gradle**

```
dependencies {
    ...
    compile project(':react-native-media-kit')
}
```

**MainActivity.java**

```
import com.greatdroid.reactnative.media.MediaKitPackage;
...
protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
    return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
        new MainReactPackage(),
            new MediaKitPackage()
    );
}
```



## Documentation

Quite same as the the HTML <Video />:

```
import {Video} from 'react-native-media-kit';
...
<Video
  style={{width: width, height: width / (16/9)}}
  src={'http://v.yoai.com/femme_tampon_tutorial.mp4'}
  autoplay={false}
  preload={'none'}
  loop={false}
  controls={true}
  muted={false}
  poster={'http://static.yoaicdn.com/shoppc/images/cover_img_e1e9e6b.jpg'}
/>
```

### API

The API is designed to mimics html [`<video />`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video).  For now, the Video and Audio component are identical.
